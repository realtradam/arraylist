# Arraylist

Generic arraylist single header implementation in C.  

## How to use
Define it in your main file like so:
```
#define ARRAYLIST_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "arraylist.h"
#undef ARRAYLIST_IMPLEMENTATION
```
and for any other files you would also like to use it in simply do
```
#include "arraylist.h"
```

Define `ARRAYLIST_DEFAULT_SIZE` to a value of your choice to change the default initialized size(number of elements) of an arraylist.
